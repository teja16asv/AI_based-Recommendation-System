This project implements a recommendation system in Java using Apache Mahout to suggest products or content based on user preferences. It leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze user interactions and generate personalized recommendations.

### Features
1. ***Collaborative Filtering***: Uses user-based and item-based recommendation techniques.
   
2. ***Apache Mahout Integration***: Utilizes Mahoutâ€™s scalable algorithms for recommendation generation.
   
3. ***Efficient Data Processing***: Handles large datasets with optimized performance.
   
4. ***Customizable Recommendations***: Supports tuning of similarity metrics and filtering approaches.
 
5. ***Sample Dataset Included***: Demonstrates functionality with test data.
   
### Technologies Used
1. Java (JDK 8+)

2. Apache Mahout (for recommendation algorithms)
   
3. Maven (for dependency management)
   
4. JSON/CSV Handling (for dataset processing)
   
### How It Works
1. Loads sample user-item interaction data.
   
2. Applies collaborative filtering algorithms to find similar users or items.
   
3. Computes recommendations based on historical user behavior.

4. Outputs personalized product/content suggestions.
   
This project serves as a practical implementation of AI-driven recommendations in Java, making it ideal for understanding machine learning-based recommendation engines and real-world application development.
